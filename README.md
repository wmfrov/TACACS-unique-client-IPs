# TACACS-unique-client-IPs
A small python script to scan your system logs and tell you how many unique IPs have connected to the TACACS server.

Usage: copy this script to the directory with your system logs and then run it. It should create a text file with the output in that same directory. If you want to restrict to a specific set of logs, say for a specific time period, you can just create a new folder and copy your logs and the script to it and run it there.
